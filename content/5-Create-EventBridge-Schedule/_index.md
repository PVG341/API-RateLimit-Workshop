In this chapter, we will create Schedules that trigger Lambda Functions to adjust the Rate and Burst settings for the API at fixed time intervals. We will also build a **RateLimitCanary Lambda Function** to dynamically adjust the Rate and Burst of the API.

**Contents:**
- [Create RateLimitCanary Lambda Function](5.1-Create-RateLimitCanary-Function/)
- [Create EventBridge Schedule](5.2-Create-EventBridge-Schedule/)
