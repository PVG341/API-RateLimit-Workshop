	"content": "Creating your first AWS account Overview In this first lab, you will be creating your new AWS account and use Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) to improve your account security. Next, you will create an Administrator Group and Admin User to manage access to resources in your account instead of using the root user. Finally, we will step through account authentication with AWS Support in the event you experience authentication problems.\nAWS Account An AWS account is the basic container for all the AWS resources you can create as an AWS customer. By default, each AWS account will have a root user. The root user has full access within your AWS account, and root user permissions cannot be limited. When you first create your AWS account, you will be assessing it as the root user.\nAs a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user for any task where it\u0026rsquo;s not required. Instead, create a new IAM user for each person that requires administrator access. Thereafter, the users in the administrators user group should set up the user groups, users, and so on, for the AWS account. All future interaction should be through the AWS account\u0026rsquo;s users and their own keys instead of the root user. However, to perform some account and service management tasks, you must log in using the root user credentials.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) MFA adds extra security because it requires users to provide unique authentication from an AWS supported MFA mechanism in addition to their regular sign-in credentials when they access AWS websites or services.\nIAM User Group An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. Any user in that user group automatically has the permissions that are assigned to the user group.\nIAM User An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials. Please note that an IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account root user.\nAWS Support AWS Basic Support offers all AWS customers access to our Resource Center, Service Health Dashboard, Product FAQs, Discussion Forums, and Support for Health Checks – at no additional charge. Customers who desire a deeper level of support can subscribe to AWS Support at the Developer, Business, or Enterprise level.\nCustomers who choose AWS Support gain one-on-one, fast-response support from AWS engineers. The service helps customers use AWS\u0026rsquo;s products and features. With pay-by-the-month pricing and unlimited support cases, customers are freed from long-term commitments. Customers with operational issues or technical questions can contact a team of support engineers and receive predictable response times and personalized support.\nMain Content Creating a new AWS Account Setting up MFA for the AWS Account root user Creating an Administrator Accounts and Groups Getting support for Account Authentication "

	"content": "View AWS account identifiers Finding your account ID as the root user You can find the AWS account ID using either the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). In the console, the location of the account ID depends on whether you\u0026rsquo;re signed in as the root user or an IAM user. The account ID remains the same whether you\u0026rsquo;re signed in as the root user or an IAM user.\nMinimum Permissions To perform the following steps, you must have at least the following IAM permissions:\nWhen you sign in as the root user, you don\u0026rsquo;t need any IAM permissions. In the navigation bar on the upper right, choose your account name or number and then choose Security credentials. Tip: If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the Security credentials option, you might be signed in as a federated user with an IAM role, instead of as an IAM user. In this case, look for the entry Account and the account ID number next to it.\nUnder the Account details section, the account number appears next to AWS account ID.\nFinding Your AWS Account ID as an IAM User Minimum Permissions To perform the following steps, you must have at least the following IAM permission:\naws-portal:ViewAccount In the navigation bar on the upper right, choose your user name and then choose Security credentials.\nTip: If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the Security credentials option, you might be signed in as a federated user with an IAM role, instead of as an IAM user.

The canonical user ID for an AWS account is specific to that account. You can retrieve the canonical user ID for your AWS account as the root user, a federated user, or an IAM user.\nFind the canonical ID as the root user or IAM user To find the canonical user ID for your account when signed in to the console as the root user or an IAM user:\nMinimum permissions:\nTo perform the following steps, you must have at least the following IAM permissions:\nWhen you run the command as the root user, you don\u0026rsquo;t need any IAM permissions.

Select Support Plan In the Select a support plan page, select an effective plan, to compare plans, see Compare AWS Support Plans. Wait for your account to be activated After selecting Support plan, the account is usually activated after a few minutes, but the process can take up to 24 hours. You will still be able to log in to your AWS account at this time, the AWS Home page may show a “Complete Sign Up” button during this time, even if you have completed all the steps in the registration section. After receiving an email confirming your account has been activated, you can access all AWS services. Important The following AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) actions will reach the end of standard support on July 2023: aws-portal:ModifyAccount and aws-portal:ViewAccount. See the Using fine-grained AWS Billing actions to replace these actions with fine-grained actions so you have access to AWS Billing, AWS Cost Management, and AWS accounts consoles.\nIf you created your AWS account or AWS Organizations Management account before March 6, 2023, the fine-grained actions will be effective starting July 2023. We recommend you to add the fine-grained actions, but not remove your existing permissions with aws-portal or purchase-orders prefixes.\nIf you created your AWS account or AWS Organizations Management account on or after March 6, 2023, the fine-grained actions are effective immediately.\nAWS assigns the following unique identifiers to each AWS account:\nAWS account ID: A 12-digit number, such as 012345678901, that uniquely identifies an AWS account. Many AWS resources include the account ID in their Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The account ID portion distinguishes resources in one account from the resources in another account. If you\u0026rsquo;re an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console using either the account ID or account alias. While account IDs, like any identifying information, should be used and shared carefully, they are not considered secret, sensitive, or confidential information.\nCanonical user ID: An alpha-numeric identifier, such as 79a59df900b949e55d96a1e698fbacedfd6e09d98eacf8f8d5218e7cd47ef2be, that is an obfuscated form of the AWS account ID. You can use this ID to identify an AWS account when granting cross-account access to buckets and objects using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). You can retrieve the canonical user ID for your AWS account as either the root user or an IAM user.\nYou must be authenticated with AWS to view these identifiers.\nWarning Do not provide your AWS credentials (including passwords and access keys) to a third party that needs your AWS account identifiers to share AWS resources with you. Doing so would give them the same access to the AWS account that you have.\n"

In the top-right corner of the console, select your account name or number, then choose Security Credentials. Under Access keys, select the access key you wish to delete, then in the Actions section, choose Delete. Note Alternatively, you can choose to Deactivate an access key instead of permanently deleting it. This allows you to continue using it in the future without changing both the key ID and secret key. While the key is deactivated, any requests using it in AWS API requests will fail with an \u0026ldquo;access denied\u0026rdquo; error.\nIn the Delete dialog, select Deactivate, enter the access key ID to confirm your intention to delete it, then choose Delete.\n"
